Objective:

Set up an E-commerce database:
Create from sketch a relational database for an online store using MySQL. 
Define appropriate integrity and referential constraints as indicated in the schema diagram.
Load historical data

Materials:

The schema diagram is provided. It will provide you with the structure, data types, primary keys, and reference constraints (See file “ecommerce schema 8 tables.png”). Use the concepts we saw in class to design the schema.
Load data automatically once you set up the schema to check that it works (data dump provided see file “Ecommerce_data_dump.sql”)
Be aware, you may encounter a minor problem. Fix it. 
 
Logistic:

Try to work individually on this one but ask for help if you get stuck. 
You have to deliver a .sql file that generates the schema. It should be working when automatically called in the shell.
