Employee table: There were 2 problems on constrains: 
-The first employee inserted is refered to the second, so it fails. => I changed the order of this pair. 
- The second employee was refered to 0, which does not exist as an employeeID. => I set the referTo to NULL.

Orders table: There were 2 problems: 
- The first regarding to the constrains. As Orders is contrained by Shippers, we should insert the records of Shippers first and then the Orders. => I put the insert into of Shippers right before the insert into of Orders.

The records with OrderID 11008, 11019, 11039, 11040, 11045, 11051, 11054, 11058, 11059, 11061, 11062, 11065, 11068, 11070, 11071, 11072, 11073, 11074, 11075, 11076 and 11077 have ShippedDate set to 0000-00-00, which is an invalid value for a datatime variable. I set them to NULL.

Order_details table: There was 1 problem:
